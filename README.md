##Python for  Reversi

This one of a  final exam for me to develop a ai for Reversi by MCTS. I have searched lots of resource, it's hard to list these. thanks for their selfless contribution!

It is a structure that similar (almost same) for [UCThello][1]
which original version is written by Javascript.

It still need to modify and improve the ability of AI, may be add some rules and better equipments.

Some pictures from the Internet, i use pygame to plot the GUI.
If you can find corresponding course in [Pygame][2]
